            <h3 class="h3">1. Research Platform </h3>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Problem </p>

            <p class="body"> Before buying a franchise, aspiring franchise owners need to research a bunch
                of franchises and sieve out the most promising ones. Aspiring owners struggle to find one
                place to do their due diligence and end up paying huge fees to franchise brokers and
                consultants for the initial research and franchise information.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Solution </p>

            <p class="body"> We developed the Krokit Research Platform, aiming to consolidate the most
                comprehensive franchise data available, setting a new industry standard.
                <br>
                <br>During my time at Krokit, I collaborated closely with the CEO, who is well-known in the
                franchise industry as
                <a class="rich-text-link" href="https://twitter.com/franchisewolf" target="_blank">The Wolf
                    of Franchises</a>. This helped me gain deep insights into the franchise sector and our user
                base.
                <br>
                <br>After research, I learnt that aspiring small business owners are not proficient in reading
                and understanding complicated data. I chose a clean and minimalist feel for the platform to
                make it easy for users to see each brand and scan through data points quickly.

            </p>

            <p class="body"> To enhance user navigation, I integrated filters, allowing users to refine
                their searches. A seemingly minor yet impactful UX detail was deciding to open each brand
                summary page in a new tab, significantly improving the browsing experience. </p>

            <p class="body"> The ability to compare franchises proved very useful to users. This feature helps
                them select two franchises side by side and easily scan through their most important metrics.

            <h3 class="h3">2. Franchisor Platform</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Problem </p>

            <p class=body>Franchisors need to see all franchisee financial data in one place and understand each
                location's performance so they can make adjustments to grow the business. </p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Solution </p>

            <p class=body>We developed Krokit for franchisors which helps them manage all their franchisee data
                in one place; and for the franchisees on the other hand (small business owners), to easily see
                their accounting data and compare their performance to other locations in the franchise.
                <br>
                <br>Building this product included chatting with CFOs, designing graphs, income statements, and
                balance sheets so I had to get my accounting chops up to speed.

            <h3 class="h3">What were the challenges, what went wrong?</h3>

            <p class="paragraph-bold">Onboarding flow</p>

            <p class="body"> Initially, the onboarding flow for the franchisor had a step where they needed to
                add their Chart of Accounts one by one. We were working on an example for a chart of accounts
                that only had ten accounts so I designed for that.
            </p>

            <img class="work-header-image" src="../assets/images/work/krokit/onboarding-chart-of-accounts-v1.webp"
                alt="Krokit Onboarding Flow V1" />

            <p class="image-caption">It became tedious to enter many accounts manually
            </p>

            <p class="body"> When the first franchise client came, they had fifty accounts! So during our
                testing, we realised that this would be a significant job for the user (lots of data input and
                typing) and would add friction to the onboarding flow. We decided to simply let them upload a
                CSV with their accounts to speed up the process.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph-bold">💡 Lesson: </span>I learnt the importance of
                designing based on realistic data.
            </p>

            <p class="image-caption">CSV uploader made things easy
            </p>

            <p class="body"> Franchisees hook up their accounting tools, such as Quickbooks, to Krokit through
                Rutter. Then, imagine the headache for franchise HQ having to sort through and manually map
                accounts for over 100 locations, picking each account from a dropdown list.
                <br>
                <br>To simplify things,
                we tapped into the OpenAI API and created an AI-driven mapping tool. It finds the account name
                that matches the closest and lets the main company link it up with just a single click:

            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold">Franchisor data sharing</p>

            <p class="body">When our first franchisor came on board, the franchise was all behind it, we had a
                call with the CEOs of the franchise and everyone seemed ready to go. After a few days, only a
                handful of locations onboarded. The franchisor themselves were surprised. We instinctively
                turned to the product - where was the problem? How can we improve the screens? Reduce clicks and
                friction?
                <br>
                <br>We launched some research calls with successful franchisees - they were open and interested
                and gave us some tips. We shipped a few iterations like the 'benchmarking' feature (which allows
                franchisees to measure their performance against other locations); also perks such as discounted
                business insurance and loans, a partner network and so on. However, nothing seemed to help much.
            </p>

            </p>


            <p class="body">During the onboarding call with our second client (over 100+ locations), we had some
                vocal franchisees. We began asking more 'why' questions and they began to push back on the idea
                of sharing their data with the franchisor. The more we dug into this, we realised we were in the
                middle of a dynamic of slight mistrust between the franchisees and franchisor HQ. We understood
                that franchisees were nervous about sharing their books with HQ - maybe some creative work had
                happened here?
                <br>
                <br> We built a feature during onboarding to let franchisees select a date to begin sharing
                their accounts - so they could begin fresh with books they know are going to be transparent and
                visible to HQ.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph"><span class="paragraph-bold">💡 Lesson: </span> Sometimes the biggest insight is
                something nobody will tell you directly - you have to ask the right questions and look between
                the lines.</p>


            <h3 class="h3">What did I learn?</h3>

            <p class="body">During my time at Krokit and the diversity of the users for each product, I learnt a
                lot about the motivations of each user group and how each flow should be tailored to that
                specific user segment. This experience also honed my collaboration skills and I thoroughly
                enjoyed
                working in a multi-cultural product team distributed between the US and the UK.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Bubble as a no-code platform is ok for building quickly and testing MVP. However, it could
                    be slow, and buggy and it has limitations in implementing designs compared to code. Bubble
                    also has unexpected updates asking users to refresh the app and we didn't have any power
                    over when these updates would be. So if I was making the call, I would have chosen to build
                    the app in code after testing the MVP in no-code or start building in code immediately.</li>
                <li>The handoff process was a bit tricky, developers interpret designs differently. The design
                    language helped so they could select from preset styles.</li>
                <li>Eventually, to enhance efficiency between design and development efforts, I started building
                    the pages and components in Bubble which were then hooked up to the backend logic.</li>
                <li>I would have loved to spend more time on the branding, but delivering the MVP for both
                    products was more important.</li>
            </ul>
