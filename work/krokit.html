                created the design language. My process involves five main stages:

            <ol>
                <li>Discovery - competitor analysis, user research and stakeholder interviews.</li>
                <li>Ideation - brainstorm, strategise and asses each idea, using Figjam and Figma for planning
                    and designing initial screens and user flows. </li>
                <li>Design - collaborative iteration, incorporating feedback before moving to the proposal, and
                    cross-functional collaboration for development.</li>
                <li>Build - supporting developers with development and testing.</li>

            <h1 class="h1-rich-text">1. Research Platform </h1>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Problem </p>

            <p class="body"> Before buying a franchise, aspiring franchise owners need to research a bunch
                of franchises and sieve out the most promising ones. Aspiring owners struggle to find one
                place to do their due diligence and end up paying huge fees to franchise brokers and
                consultants for the initial research and franchise information.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Solution </p>

            <p class="body"> We developed the Krokit Research Platform, aiming to consolidate the most
                comprehensive franchise data available, setting a new industry standard. </p>
            <p class="body"> During my time at Krokit, I collaborated closely with the CEO, who is well-known in the
                franchise industry as
                <a class="rich-text-link" href="https://twitter.com/franchisewolf" target="_blank">The Wolf
                    of Franchises</a>. This helped me gain deep insights into the franchise sector and our user
                base.
            </p>
            <p class="body"> After research, I learnt that aspiring small business owners are not proficient in reading
                and understanding complicated data. I chose a clean and minimalist feel for the platform to
                make it easy for users to see each brand and scan through data points quickly.

            </p>

            <p class="body"> To enhance user navigation, I integrated filters, allowing users to refine
                their searches. A seemingly minor yet impactful UX detail was deciding to open each brand
                summary page in a new tab, significantly improving the browsing experience. </p>

            <p class="body"> The ability to compare franchises proved very useful to users. This feature helps
                them select two franchises side by side and easily scan through their most important metrics.

            <h1 class="h1-rich-text">2. Franchisor Platform</h1>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Problem </p>

            <p class=body>Franchisors need to see all franchisee financial data in one place and understand each
                location's performance so they can make adjustments to grow the business. </p>

            <p class="paragraph-bold"> Solution </p>

            <p class=body>We developed Krokit for franchisors which helps them manage all their franchisee data
                in one place; and for the franchisees on the other hand (small business owners), to easily see
                their accounting data and compare their performance to other locations in the franchise. </p>

            <p class="body">Building this product included chatting with CFOs, designing graphs, income statements, and
                balance sheets so I had to get my accounting chops up to speed. </p>
            <p class="body-italic">There were a lot of challenges along the way, for example, the onboarding flow and
                franchisor data
                sharing. I am not sharing these learnings publicly due to company privacy.

            <h1 class="h1-rich-text">What did I learn?</h1>

            <p class="body"> Each Krokit product had diverse user groups and I learnt a lot about the motivations of
                each group and how product flows should be tailored to the specific user segment. A big lesson was also the importance of designing based on
                realistic data. The experience at Krokit also honed my collaboration skills and I thoroughly
                enjoyed working in a multi-cultural product team distributed between the US and the UK. A few key
                takeaways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bubble as a no-code platform is ok for building quickly and testing MVP. However, it could
                    be slow, and buggy and it has limitations in implementing designs compared to code. Bubble
                    also has unexpected updates asking users to refresh the app and we didn't have any power
                    over when these updates would be. So if I was making the call, I would have chosen to build
                    the app in code after testing the MVP in no-code or start building in code immediately.</li>
                <li>The handoff process was a bit tricky, developers interpret designs differently. The design
                    language helped so they could select from preset styles.</li>
                <li>Eventually, to enhance efficiency between design and development efforts, I started building
                    the pages and components in Bubble which were then hooked up to the backend logic.</li>
                <li>I would have loved to spend more time on the branding, but delivering the MVP for both
                    products was more important.</li>
            </ul>
